BufferedReader 
All Implemented Interfaces : Closeable , AutoCloseable , Readable 
Direct Known Subclasses : LineNumberReader 
<pre> public class BufferedReader extends Reader </pre> Reads text from a character - input stream , buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters , arrays , and lines . 
<p> The buffer size may be specified , or the default size may be used . 
The default is large enough for most purposes . 
<p> In general , each read request made of a Reader causes a corresponding read request to be made of the underlying character or byte stream . 
It is therefore advisable to wrap a BufferedReader around any Reader whose read ( ) operations may be costly , such as FileReaders and InputStreamReaders . 
For example , 
<pre> BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( " foo . in " ) ) ; </pre> 
will buffer the input from the specified file . 
Without buffering , each invocation of read ( ) or readLine ( ) could cause bytes to be read from the file , converted into characters , and then returned , which can be very inefficient . 
<p> Programs that use DataInputStreams for textual input can be localized by replacing each DataInputStream with an appropriate BufferedReader .

Constructor Detail 
BufferedReader <pre> public BufferedReader ( Reader in , int sz ) </pre> Creates a buffering character - input stream that uses an input buffer of the specified size . 
Parameters : <code> in </code> - A Reader <code> sz </code> - Input - buffer size Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - If <code> sz < = 0 </code> 
BufferedReader <pre> public BufferedReader ( Reader in ) </pre> Creates a buffering character - input stream that uses a default - sized input buffer . 
Parameters : <code> in </code> - A Reader 
Method Detail 
read <pre> public int read ( ) throws IOException </pre> Reads a single character . 
Overrides : <code> read </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Returns : The character read , as an integer in the range 0 to 65535 ( 0x00 - 0xffff ) , or - 1 if the end of the stream has been reached Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
read <pre> public int read ( char [ ] cbuf , int off , int len ) throws IOException </pre> Reads characters into a portion of an array . 
<p> This method implements the general contract of the corresponding <code> <code> read method of the <code> <code> Reader class . As an additional convenience , it attempts to read as many characters as possible by repeatedly invoking the <code> read </code> method of the underlying stream . 
This iterated <code> read </code> continues until one of the following conditions becomes true : The specified number of characters have been read , 
The <code> read </code> method of the underlying stream returns <code> - 1 </code> , indicating end - of - file , or 
The <code> ready </code> method of the underlying stream returns <code> false </code> , indicating that further input requests would block . 
If the first <code> read </code> on the underlying stream returns <code> - 1 </code> to indicate end - of - file then this method returns <code> - 1 </code> . 
Otherwise this method returns the number of characters actually read . 
<p> Subclasses of this class are encouraged , but not required , to attempt to read as many characters as possible in the same fashion . 
<p> Ordinarily this method takes characters from this stream ' s character buffer , filling it from the underlying stream as necessary . 
If , however , the buffer is empty , the mark is not valid , and the requested length is at least as large as the buffer , then this method will read characters directly from the underlying stream into the given array . Thus redundant <code> BufferedReader </code> s will not copy data unnecessarily . 
Specified by : <code> read </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Parameters : <code> cbuf </code> - Destination buffer <code> off </code> - Offset at which to start storing characters <code> len </code> - Maximum number of characters to read Returns : The number of characters read , or - 1 if the end of the stream has been reached Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
readLine <pre> public String readLine ( ) throws IOException </pre> Reads a line of text . 
A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed ( ' \ n ' ) , a carriage return ( ' \ r ' ) , or a carriage return followed immediately by a linefeed . 
Returns : A String containing the contents of the line , not including any line - termination characters , or null if the end of the stream has been reached Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs See Also : <code> Files . readAllLines ( java . nio . file . Path , java . nio . charset . Charset ) </code> 
skip <pre> public long skip ( long n ) throws IOException </pre> Skips characters . 
Overrides : <code> skip </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Parameters : <code> n </code> - The number of characters to skip Returns : The number of characters actually skipped Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - If <code> n </code> is negative . <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
ready <pre> public boolean ready ( ) throws IOException </pre> Tells whether this stream is ready to be read . 
A buffered character stream is ready if the buffer is not empty , or if the underlying character stream is ready . 
Overrides : <code> ready </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Returns : True if the next read ( ) is guaranteed not to block for input , false otherwise . 
Note that returning false does not guarantee that the next read will block . Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
markSupported <pre> public boolean markSupported ( ) </pre> Tells whether this stream supports the mark ( ) operation , which it does . 
Overrides : <code> markSupported </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Returns : true if and only if this stream supports the mark operation . 
mark <pre> public void mark ( int readAheadLimit ) throws IOException </pre> Marks the present position in the stream . 
Subsequent calls to reset ( ) will attempt to reposition the stream to this point . 
Overrides : <code> mark </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Parameters : <code> readAheadLimit </code> - Limit on the number of characters that may be read while still preserving the mark . 
An attempt to reset the stream after reading characters up to this limit or beyond may fail . A limit value larger than the size of the input buffer will cause a new buffer to be allocated whose size is no smaller than limit . Therefore large values should be used with care . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - If <code> readAheadLimit < 0 </code> <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
reset <pre> public void reset ( ) throws IOException </pre> Resets the stream to the most recent mark . 
Overrides : <code> reset </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If the stream has never been marked , or if the mark has been invalidated 
close <pre> public void close ( ) throws IOException </pre> Description copied from class : <code> Reader </code> Closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it . 
Once the stream has been closed , further read ( ) , ready ( ) , mark ( ) , reset ( ) , or skip ( ) invocations will throw an IOException . Closing a previously closed stream has no effect . 
Specified by : <code> close </code> in interface <code> Closeable </code> Specified by : <code> close </code> in interface <code> AutoCloseable </code> Specified by : <code> close </code> in class <code> Reader </code> Throws : <code> IOException </code> - If an I / O error occurs 
lines <pre> public Stream <String> lines ( ) </pre> Returns a <code> Stream </code> , the elements of which are lines read from this <code> BufferedReader </code> . 
The <code> Stream </code> is lazily populated , i . e . , read only occurs during the terminal stream operation . 
<p> The reader must not be operated on during the execution of the terminal stream operation . 
Otherwise , the result of the terminal stream operation is undefined . 
<p> After execution of the terminal stream operation there are no guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to read the next character or line . 
<p> If an <code> IOException </code> is thrown when accessing the underlying <code> BufferedReader </code> , it is wrapped in an <code> UncheckedIOException </code> which will be thrown from the <code> Stream </code> method that caused the read to take place . 
This method will return a Stream if invoked on a BufferedReader that is closed . 
Any operation on that stream that requires reading from the BufferedReader after it is closed , will cause an UncheckedIOException to be thrown . 
Returns : a <code> Stream providing the lines of text described by this <code> BufferedReader </code> Since : 1 . 8
