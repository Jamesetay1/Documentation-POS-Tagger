Timer 
<pre> public class Timer extends Object </pre> A facility for threads to schedule tasks for future execution in a background thread . 
Tasks may be scheduled for one - time execution , or for repeated execution at regular intervals . 
<p> Corresponding to each Timer object is a single background thread that is used to execute all of the timer ' s tasks , sequentially . Timer tasks should complete quickly . 
If a timer task takes excessive time to complete , it " hogs " the timer ' s task execution thread . 
This can , in turn , delay the execution of subsequent tasks , which may " bunch up " and execute in rapid succession when ( and if ) the offending task finally completes . 
<p> After the last live reference to a Timer object goes away and all outstanding tasks have completed execution , the timer ' s task execution thread terminates gracefully ( and becomes subject to garbage collection ) . 
However , this can take arbitrarily long to occur . 
By default , the task execution thread does not run as a daemon thread , so it is capable of keeping an application from terminating . 
If a caller wants to terminate a timer ' s task execution thread rapidly , the caller should invoke the timer ' s cancel method . 
<p> If the timer ' s task execution thread terminates unexpectedly , for example , because its stop method is invoked , any further attempt to schedule a task on the timer will result in an IllegalStateException , as if the timer ' s cancel method had been invoked . 
<p> This class is thread - safe : multiple threads can share a single Timer object without the need for external synchronization . 
<p> This class does not offer real - time guarantees : it schedules tasks using the Object . wait ( long ) method . 
<p> Java 5 . 0 introduced the <code> java . util . concurrent </code> package and one of the concurrency utilities therein is the <code> ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor </code> which is a thread pool for repeatedly executing tasks at a given rate or delay . 
It is effectively a more versatile replacement for the <code> Timer </code> / <code> TimerTask </code> combination , as it allows multiple service threads , accepts various time units , and doesn ' t require subclassing <code> TimerTask </code> ( just implement <code> Runnable </code> ) . 
Configuring <code> ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor </code> with one thread makes it equivalent to <code> Timer </code> . 
<p> Implementation note : This class scales to large numbers of concurrently scheduled tasks ( thousands should present no problem ) . 
Internally , it uses a binary heap to represent its task queue , so the cost to schedule a task is O ( log n ) , where n is the number of concurrently scheduled tasks . 
<p> Implementation note : All constructors start a timer thread .

Constructor Detail 
Timer <pre> public Timer ( ) </pre> Creates a new timer . 
The associated thread does not run as a daemon . 
Timer <pre> public Timer ( boolean isDaemon ) </pre> Creates a new timer whose associated thread may be specified to run as a daemon . A daemon thread is called for if the timer will be used to schedule repeating " maintenance activities " , which must be performed as long as the application is running , but should not prolong the lifetime of the application . 
Parameters : <code> isDaemon </code> - true if the associated thread should run as a daemon . 
Timer <pre> public Timer ( String name ) </pre> Creates a new timer whose associated thread has the specified name . The associated thread does not run as a daemon . 
Parameters : <code> name </code> - the name of the associated thread Throws : <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> name </code> is null Since : 1 . 5 
Timer <pre> public Timer ( String name , boolean isDaemon ) </pre> Creates a new timer whose associated thread has the specified name , and may be specified to run as a daemon . 
Parameters : <code> name </code> - the name of the associated thread <code> isDaemon </code> - true if the associated thread should run as a daemon Throws : <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> name </code> is null Since : 1 . 5 
Method Detail 
schedule <pre> public void schedule ( TimerTask task , long delay ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for execution after the specified delay . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> delay </code> - delay in milliseconds before task is to be executed . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if delay is negative , or delay + System . currentTimeMillis ( ) is negative . <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> is null 
schedule <pre> public void schedule ( TimerTask task , Date time ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for execution at the specified time . 
If the time is in the past , the task is scheduled for immediate execution . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> time </code> - time at which task is to be executed . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if time . getTime ( ) is negative . <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> or <code> time </code> is null 
schedule <pre> public void schedule ( TimerTask task , long delay , long period ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for repeated fixed - delay execution , beginning after the specified delay . 
Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals separated by the specified period . 
<p> In fixed - delay execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution . 
If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , subsequent executions will be delayed as well . In the long run , the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying Object . wait ( long ) is accurate ) . 
<p> Fixed - delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require " smoothness . " In other words , it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run . 
This includes most animation tasks , such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals . 
It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input , such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> delay </code> - delay in milliseconds before task is to be executed . <code> period </code> - time in milliseconds between successive task executions . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if <code> delay < 0 </code> , or <code> delay + System . currentTimeMillis ( ) < 0 </code> , or <code> period < = 0 </code> <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> is null 
schedule <pre> public void schedule ( TimerTask task , Date firstTime , long period ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for repeated fixed - delay execution , beginning at the specified time . 
Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . 
<p> In fixed - delay execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the actual execution time of the previous execution . 
If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , subsequent executions will be delayed as well . In the long run , the frequency of execution will generally be slightly lower than the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying Object . wait ( long ) is accurate ) . 
As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , it is scheduled for immediate execution . 
<p> Fixed - delay execution is appropriate for recurring activities that require " smoothness . " In other words , it is appropriate for activities where it is more important to keep the frequency accurate in the short run than in the long run . 
This includes most animation tasks , such as blinking a cursor at regular intervals . 
It also includes tasks wherein regular activity is performed in response to human input , such as automatically repeating a character as long as a key is held down . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> firstTime </code> - First time at which task is to be executed . <code> period </code> - time in milliseconds between successive task executions . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if <code> firstTime . getTime ( ) < 0 </code> , or <code> period < = 0 </code> <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> or <code> firstTime </code> is null 
scheduleAtFixedRate <pre> public void scheduleAtFixedRate ( TimerTask task , long delay , long period ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for repeated fixed - rate execution , beginning after the specified delay . 
Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . 
<p> In fixed - rate execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution . 
If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to " catch up . " In the long run , the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying Object . wait ( long ) is accurate ) . 
<p> Fixed - rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute time , such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour , or running scheduled maintenance every day at a particular time . 
It is also appropriate for recurring activities where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important , such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds . 
Finally , fixed - rate execution is appropriate for scheduling multiple repeating timer tasks that must remain synchronized with respect to one another . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> delay </code> - delay in milliseconds before task is to be executed . <code> period </code> - time in milliseconds between successive task executions . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if <code> delay < 0 </code> , or <code> delay + System . currentTimeMillis ( ) < 0 </code> , or <code> period < = 0 </code> <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> is null 
scheduleAtFixedRate <pre> public void scheduleAtFixedRate ( TimerTask task , Date firstTime , long period ) </pre> Schedules the specified task for repeated fixed - rate execution , beginning at the specified time . 
Subsequent executions take place at approximately regular intervals , separated by the specified period . 
<p> In fixed - rate execution , each execution is scheduled relative to the scheduled execution time of the initial execution . 
If an execution is delayed for any reason ( such as garbage collection or other background activity ) , two or more executions will occur in rapid succession to " catch up . " In the long run , the frequency of execution will be exactly the reciprocal of the specified period ( assuming the system clock underlying Object . wait ( long ) is accurate ) . 
As a consequence of the above , if the scheduled first time is in the past , then any " missed " executions will be scheduled for immediate " catch up " execution . 
<p> Fixed - rate execution is appropriate for recurring activities that are sensitive to absolute time , such as ringing a chime every hour on the hour , or running scheduled maintenance every day at a particular time . 
It is also appropriate for recurring activities where the total time to perform a fixed number of executions is important , such as a countdown timer that ticks once every second for ten seconds . 
Finally , fixed - rate execution is appropriate for scheduling multiple repeating timer tasks that must remain synchronized with respect to one another . 
Parameters : <code> task </code> - task to be scheduled . <code> firstTime </code> - First time at which task is to be executed . <code> period </code> - time in milliseconds between successive task executions . Throws : <code> IllegalArgumentException </code> - if <code> firstTime . getTime ( ) < 0 </code> or <code> period < = 0 </code> <code> IllegalStateException </code> - if task was already scheduled or cancelled , timer was cancelled , or timer thread terminated . <code> NullPointerException </code> - if <code> task </code> or <code> firstTime </code> is null 
cancel <pre> public void cancel ( ) </pre> Terminates this timer , discarding any currently scheduled tasks . Does not interfere with a currently executing task ( if it exists ) . Once a timer has been terminated , its execution thread terminates gracefully , and no more tasks may be scheduled on it . 
<p> Note that calling this method from within the run method of a timer task that was invoked by this timer absolutely guarantees that the ongoing task execution is the last task execution that will ever be performed by this timer . 
<p> This method may be called repeatedly ; the second and subsequent calls have no effect . 
purge <pre> public int purge ( ) </pre> Removes all cancelled tasks from this timer ' s task queue . 
Calling this method has no effect on the behavior of the timer , but eliminates the references to the cancelled tasks from the queue . If there are no external references to these tasks , they become eligible for garbage collection . 
<p> Most programs will have no need to call this method . It is designed for use by the rare application that cancels a large number of tasks . 
Calling this method trades time for space : the runtime of the method may be proportional to n + c log n , where n is the number of tasks in the queue and c is the number of cancelled tasks . 
<p> Note that it is permissible to call this method from within a a task scheduled on this timer . 
Returns : the number of tasks removed from the queue . Since : 1 . 5
