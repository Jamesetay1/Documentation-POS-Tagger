<p>Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list <em>k</em> at a time and return its modified list.</p>

<p><em>k</em> is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of <em>k</em> then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.</p>

<p>Follow up:</p>

Could you solve the problem in <code>O(1)</code> extra memory space?
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.

<p> </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
</pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
</pre>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<pre>
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
</pre>

<p>Example 4:</p>

<pre>
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p>Constraints:</p>

The number of nodes in the list is in the range <code>sz</code>.
<code>1 <= sz <= 5000</code>
<code>0 <= Node.val <= 1000</code>
<code>1 <= k <= sz</code>
