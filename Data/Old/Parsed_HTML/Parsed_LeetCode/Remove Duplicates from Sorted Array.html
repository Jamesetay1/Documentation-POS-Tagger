<p>Given a sorted array <em>nums</em>, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only <em>once</em> and returns the new length.</p>

<p>Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.</p>

<p>Clarification:</p>

<p>Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?</p>

<p>Note that the input array is passed in by reference, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.</p>

<p>Internally you can think of this:</p>

<pre>
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}</pre>

<p> </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre>
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = <code>2</code>, with the first two elements of <em><code>nums</code></em> being <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
</pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre>
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = <code>5</code>, with the first five elements of <em><code>nums</code></em> being modified to <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p>Constraints:</p>

<code>0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104</code>
<code>-104 <= nums[i] <= 104</code>
<code>nums</code> is sorted in ascending order.
