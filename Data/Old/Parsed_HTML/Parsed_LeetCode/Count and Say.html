<p>The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:</p>

<code>countAndSay(1) = "1"</code>
<code>countAndSay(n)</code> is the way you would "say" the digit string from <code>countAndSay(n-1)</code>, which is then converted into a different digit string.

<p>To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.</p>

<p>For example, the saying and conversion for digit string <code>"3322251"</code>:</p>

<p>Given a positive integer <code>n</code>, return <em>the </em><code>nth</code><em> term of the count-and-say sequence</em>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre>
Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
</pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre>
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p>Constraints:</p>

<code>1 <= n <= 30</code>
