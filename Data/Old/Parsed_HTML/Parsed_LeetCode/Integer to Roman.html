<p>Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: <code>I</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>M</code>.</p>

<pre>
Symbol Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000</pre>

<p>For example, <code>2</code> is written as <code>II</code> in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. <code>12</code> is written as <code>XII</code>, which is simply <code>X + II</code>. The number <code>27</code> is written as <code>XXVII</code>, which is <code>XX + V + II</code>.</p>

<p>Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <code>IIII</code>. Instead, the number four is written as <code>IV</code>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <code>IX</code>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:</p>

<code>I</code> can be placed before <code>V</code> (5) and <code>X</code> (10) to make 4 and 9. 
<code>X</code> can be placed before <code>L</code> (50) and <code>C</code> (100) to make 40 and 90. 
<code>C</code> can be placed before <code>D</code> (500) and <code>M</code> (1000) to make 400 and 900.

<p>Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>

<pre>
Input: num = 3
Output: "III"
</pre>

<p>Example 2:</p>

<pre>
Input: num = 4
Output: "IV"
</pre>

<p>Example 3:</p>

<pre>
Input: num = 9
Output: "IX"
</pre>

<p>Example 4:</p>

<pre>
Input: num = 58
Output: "LVIII"
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.
</pre>

<p>Example 5:</p>

<pre>
Input: num = 1994
Output: "MCMXCIV"
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p>Constraints:</p>

<code>1 <= num <= 3999</code>
