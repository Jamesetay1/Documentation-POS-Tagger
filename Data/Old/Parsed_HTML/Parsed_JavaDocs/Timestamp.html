Constructor Detail

Timestamp
<pre>public Timestamp(Date timestamp,
                 CertPath signerCertPath)</pre>
Constructs a Timestamp.

Parameters:
<code>timestamp</code> - is the timestamp's date and time. It must not be null.
<code>signerCertPath</code> - is the TSA's certificate path. It must not be null.
Throws:
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if timestamp or signerCertPath is null.

Method Detail

getTimestamp
<pre>public Date getTimestamp()</pre>
Returns the date and time when the timestamp was generated.

Returns:
The timestamp's date and time.

getSignerCertPath
<pre>public CertPath getSignerCertPath()</pre>
Returns the certificate path for the Timestamping Authority.

Returns:
The TSA's certificate path.

hashCode
<pre>public int hashCode()</pre>
Returns the hash code value for this timestamp.
 The hash code is generated using the date and time of the timestamp
 and the TSA's certificate path.

Overrides:
<code>hashCode</code> in class <code>Object</code>
Returns:
a hash code value for this timestamp.
See Also:
<code>Object.equals(java.lang.Object)</code>, 
<code>System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)</code>

equals
<pre>public boolean equals(Object obj)</pre>
Tests for equality between the specified object and this
 timestamp. Two timestamps are considered equal if the date and time of
 their timestamp's and their signer's certificate paths are equal.

Overrides:
<code>equals</code> in class <code>Object</code>
Parameters:
<code>obj</code> - the object to test for equality with this timestamp.
Returns:
true if the timestamp are considered equal, false otherwise.
See Also:
<code>Object.hashCode()</code>, 
<code>HashMap</code>

toString
<pre>public String toString()</pre>
Returns a string describing this timestamp.

Overrides:
<code>toString</code> in class <code>Object</code>
Returns:
A string comprising the date and time of the timestamp and
         its signer's certificate.
