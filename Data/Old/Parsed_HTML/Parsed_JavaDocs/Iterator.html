Interface Iterator<E>

Type Parameters:
<code>E</code> - the type of elements returned by this iterator

All Known Subinterfaces:
ListIterator<E>, PrimitiveIterator<T,T_CONS>, PrimitiveIterator.OfDouble, PrimitiveIterator.OfInt, PrimitiveIterator.OfLong, XMLEventReader

All Known Implementing Classes:
BeanContextSupport.BCSIterator, EventReaderDelegate, Scanner

<pre>public interface Iterator<E></pre>
An iterator over a collection.  <code>Iterator</code> takes the place of
 <code>Enumeration</code> in the Java Collections Framework.  Iterators
 differ from enumerations in two ways:

 
 Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the
           underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined
           semantics.
       Method names have been improved.
 

 <p>This interface is a member of the
 
 Java Collections Framework.

Since:
1.2

Method Summary

All Methods Instance Methods Abstract Methods Default Methods 

Modifier and Type
Method and Description

<code>default void</code>
<code>forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action)</code>
Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements
 have been processed or the action throws an exception.

<code>boolean</code>
<code>hasNext()</code>
Returns <code>true</code> if the iteration has more elements.

<code>E</code>
<code>next()</code>
Returns the next element in the iteration.

<code>default void</code>
<code>remove()</code>
Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
 by this iterator (optional operation).

Method Detail

hasNext
<pre>boolean hasNext()</pre>
Returns <code>true</code> if the iteration has more elements.
 (In other words, returns <code>true</code> if <code>next()</code> would
 return an element rather than throwing an exception.)

Returns:
<code>true</code> if the iteration has more elements

next
<pre>E next()</pre>
Returns the next element in the iteration.

Returns:
the next element in the iteration
Throws:
<code>NoSuchElementException</code> - if the iteration has no more elements

remove
<pre>default void remove()</pre>
Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned
 by this iterator (optional operation).  This method can be called
 only once per call to <code>next()</code>.  The behavior of an iterator
 is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified while the
 iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this
 method.

Implementation Requirements:
The default implementation throws an instance of
 <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> and performs no other action.
Throws:
<code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> - if the <code>remove</code>
         operation is not supported by this iterator
<code>IllegalStateException</code> - if the <code>next</code> method has not
         yet been called, or the <code>remove</code> method has already
         been called after the last call to the <code>next</code>
         method

forEachRemaining
<pre>default void forEachRemaining(Consumer<? super E> action)</pre>
Performs the given action for each remaining element until all elements
 have been processed or the action throws an exception.  Actions are
 performed in the order of iteration, if that order is specified.
 Exceptions thrown by the action are relayed to the caller.

Implementation Requirements:
<p>The default implementation behaves as if:
 <pre><code>
     while (hasNext())
         action.accept(next());
 </code></pre>
Parameters:
<code>action</code> - The action to be performed for each element
Throws:
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if the specified action is null
