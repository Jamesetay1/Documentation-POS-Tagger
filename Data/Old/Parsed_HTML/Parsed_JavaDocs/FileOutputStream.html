All Implemented Interfaces:

<pre>public class FileOutputStream
extends OutputStream</pre>
A file output stream is an output stream for writing data to a
 <code>File</code> or to a <code>FileDescriptor</code>. Whether or not
 a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying
 platform.  Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened
 for writing by only one FileOutputStream (or other
 file-writing object) at a time.  In such situations the constructors in
 this class will fail if the file involved is already open.

 <p><code>FileOutputStream</code> is meant for writing streams of raw bytes
 such as image data. For writing streams of characters, consider using
 <code>FileWriter</code>.

Constructor Detail

FileOutputStream
<pre>public FileOutputStream(String name)
                 throws FileNotFoundException</pre>
Creates a file output stream to write to the file with the
 specified name. A new <code>FileDescriptor</code> object is
 created to represent this file connection.
 <p>
 First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkWrite</code>
 method is called with <code>name</code> as its argument.
 <p>
 If the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does
 not exist but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other
 reason then a <code>FileNotFoundException</code> is thrown.

Parameters:
<code>name</code> - the system-dependent filename
Throws:
<code>FileNotFoundException</code> - if the file exists but is a directory
                   rather than a regular file, does not exist but cannot
                   be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason
<code>SecurityException</code> - if a security manager exists and its
               <code>checkWrite</code> method denies write access
               to the file.
See Also:
<code>SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.lang.String)</code>

                   be created, or cannot be opened for any other reason.
<code>SecurityException</code> - if a security manager exists and its

 method is called with the path represented by the <code>file</code>
 argument as its argument.
 <p>
 If the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does
 not exist but cannot be created, or cannot be opened for any other
 reason then a <code>FileNotFoundException</code> is thrown.

Parameters:

                 throws FileNotFoundException</pre>
Creates a file output stream to write to the file represented by
 the specified <code>File</code> object. If the second argument is
 <code>true</code>, then bytes will be written to the end of the file
 rather than the beginning. A new <code>FileDescriptor</code> object is
 created to represent this file connection.
 <p>
 First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkWrite</code>
 method is called with the path represented by the <code>file</code>
 argument as its argument.
 <p>
 If the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular file, does

FileOutputStream
<pre>public FileOutputStream(FileDescriptor fdObj)</pre>
Creates a file output stream to write to the specified file
 descriptor, which represents an existing connection to an actual
 file in the file system.
 <p>
 First, if there is a security manager, its <code>checkWrite</code>
 method is called with the file descriptor <code>fdObj</code>
 argument as its argument.
 <p>
 If <code>fdObj</code> is null then a <code>NullPointerException</code>
 is thrown.
 <p>
 This constructor does not throw an exception if <code>fdObj</code>
 is <code>invalid</code>.
 However, if the methods are invoked on the resulting stream to attempt
 I/O on the stream, an <code>IOException</code> is thrown.

Parameters:
<code>fdObj</code> - the file descriptor to be opened for writing
Throws:
<code>SecurityException</code> - if a security manager exists and its
               <code>checkWrite</code> method denies
               write access to the file descriptor
See Also:
<code>SecurityManager.checkWrite(java.io.FileDescriptor)</code>

Method Detail

write
<pre>public void write(int b)
           throws IOException</pre>
Writes the specified byte to this file output stream. Implements
 the <code>write</code> method of <code>OutputStream</code>.

Specified by:
<code>write</code> in class <code>OutputStream</code>
Parameters:
<code>b</code> - the byte to be written.
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.

write
<pre>public void write(byte[] b)
           throws IOException</pre>
Writes <code>b.length</code> bytes from the specified byte array
 to this file output stream.

Overrides:
<code>write</code> in class <code>OutputStream</code>
Parameters:
<code>b</code> - the data.
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
<code>OutputStream.write(byte[], int, int)</code>

write
<pre>public void write(byte[] b,
                  int off,
                  int len)
           throws IOException</pre>
Writes <code>len</code> bytes from the specified byte array
 starting at offset <code>off</code> to this file output stream.

Overrides:
<code>write</code> in class <code>OutputStream</code>
Parameters:
<code>b</code> - the data.
<code>off</code> - the start offset in the data.
<code>len</code> - the number of bytes to write.
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.

close
<pre>public void close()
           throws IOException</pre>
Closes this file output stream and releases any system resources
 associated with this stream. This file output stream may no longer
 be used for writing bytes.

 <p> If this stream has an associated channel then the channel is closed
 as well.

Specified by:
<code>close</code> in interface <code>Closeable</code>
Specified by:
<code>close</code> in interface <code>AutoCloseable</code>
Overrides:
<code>close</code> in class <code>OutputStream</code>
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.

getFD
<pre>public final FileDescriptor getFD()
                           throws IOException</pre>
Returns the file descriptor associated with this stream.

Returns:
the <code>FileDescriptor</code> object that represents
          the connection to the file in the file system being used
          by this <code>FileOutputStream</code> object.
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
<code>FileDescriptor</code>

getChannel
<pre>public FileChannel getChannel()</pre>
Returns the unique <code>FileChannel</code>
 object associated with this file output stream.

 <p> The initial <code>position</code> of the returned channel will be equal to the
 number of bytes written to the file so far unless this stream is in
 append mode, in which case it will be equal to the size of the file.
 Writing bytes to this stream will increment the channel's position
 accordingly.  Changing the channel's position, either explicitly or by
 writing, will change this stream's file position.

Returns:
the file channel associated with this file output stream
Since:
1.4

finalize
<pre>protected void finalize()
                 throws IOException</pre>
Cleans up the connection to the file, and ensures that the
 <code>close</code> method of this file output stream is
 called when there are no more references to this stream.

Overrides:
<code>finalize</code> in class <code>Object</code>
Throws:
<code>IOException</code> - if an I/O error occurs.
See Also:
<code>FileInputStream.close()</code>
