Class Dictionary<K,V>

java.lang.Object

java.util.Dictionary<K,V>

Direct Known Subclasses:
Hashtable

<pre>public abstract class Dictionary<K,V>
extends Object</pre>
The <code>Dictionary</code> class is the abstract parent of any
 class, such as <code>Hashtable</code>, which maps keys to values.
 Every key and every value is an object. In any one Dictionary
 object, every key is associated with at most one value. Given a
 Dictionary and a key, the associated element can be looked up.
 Any non-<code>null</code> object can be used as a key and as a value.
 <p>
 As a rule, the <code>equals</code> method should be used by
 implementations of this class to decide if two keys are the same.
 <p>
 NOTE: This class is obsolete.  New implementations should
 implement the Map interface, rather than extending this class.

Since:
JDK1.0

Constructor Detail

Dictionary
<pre>public Dictionary()</pre>
Sole constructor.  (For invocation by subclass constructors, typically
 implicit.)

Method Detail

size
<pre>public abstract int size()</pre>
Returns the number of entries (distinct keys) in this dictionary.

Returns:
the number of keys in this dictionary.

isEmpty
<pre>public abstract boolean isEmpty()</pre>
Tests if this dictionary maps no keys to value. The general contract
 for the isEmpty method is that the result is true if and only
 if this dictionary contains no entries.

Returns:
<code>true</code> if this dictionary maps no keys to values;
          <code>false</code> otherwise.

keys
<pre>public abstract Enumeration<K> keys()</pre>
Returns an enumeration of the keys in this dictionary. The general
 contract for the keys method is that an Enumeration object
 is returned that will generate all the keys for which this dictionary
 contains entries.

Returns:
an enumeration of the keys in this dictionary.
See Also:
<code>elements()</code>, 
<code>Enumeration</code>

elements
<pre>public abstract Enumeration<V> elements()</pre>
Returns an enumeration of the values in this dictionary. The general
 contract for the elements method is that an
 Enumeration is returned that will generate all the elements
 contained in entries in this dictionary.

Returns:
an enumeration of the values in this dictionary.
See Also:
<code>keys()</code>, 
<code>Enumeration</code>

get
<pre>public abstract V get(Object key)</pre>
Returns the value to which the key is mapped in this dictionary.
 The general contract for the isEmpty method is that if this
 dictionary contains an entry for the specified key, the associated
 value is returned; otherwise, null is returned.

Parameters:
<code>key</code> - a key in this dictionary.
          <code>null</code> if the key is not mapped to any value in
          this dictionary.
Returns:
the value to which the key is mapped in this dictionary;
Throws:
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if the key is null.
See Also:
<code>put(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)</code>

put
<pre>public abstract V put(K key,
                      V value)</pre>
Maps the specified <code>key</code> to the specified
 <code>value</code> in this dictionary. Neither the key nor the
 value can be <code>null</code>.
 <p>
 If this dictionary already contains an entry for the specified
 key, the value already in this dictionary for that
 key is returned, after modifying the entry to contain the
  new element. <p>If this dictionary does not already have an entry
  for the specified key, an entry is created for the
  specified key and value, and null is
  returned.
 <p>
 The <code>value</code> can be retrieved by calling the
 <code>get</code> method with a <code>key</code> that is equal to
 the original <code>key</code>.

Parameters:
<code>key</code> - the hashtable key.
<code>value</code> - the value.
Returns:
the previous value to which the <code>key</code> was mapped
             in this dictionary, or <code>null</code> if the key did not
             have a previous mapping.
Throws:
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if the <code>key</code> or
               <code>value</code> is <code>null</code>.
See Also:
<code>Object.equals(java.lang.Object)</code>, 
<code>get(java.lang.Object)</code>

remove
<pre>public abstract V remove(Object key)</pre>
Removes the <code>key</code> (and its corresponding
 <code>value</code>) from this dictionary. This method does nothing
 if the <code>key</code> is not in this dictionary.

Parameters:
<code>key</code> - the key that needs to be removed.
Returns:
the value to which the <code>key</code> had been mapped in this
          dictionary, or <code>null</code> if the key did not have a
          mapping.
Throws:
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if key is null.
