Class Process

java.lang.Object

java.lang.Process

<pre>public abstract class Process
extends Object</pre>
The <code>ProcessBuilder.start()</code> and
 <code>Runtime.exec</code>
 methods create a native process and return an instance of a
 subclass of <code>Process</code> that can be used to control the process
 and obtain information about it.  The class <code>Process</code>
 provides methods for performing input from the process, performing
 output to the process, waiting for the process to complete,
 checking the exit status of the process, and destroying (killing)
 the process.

 <p>The methods that create processes may not work well for special
 processes on certain native platforms, such as native windowing
 processes, daemon processes, Win16/DOS processes on Microsoft
 Windows, or shell scripts.

 <p>By default, the created subprocess does not have its own terminal
 or console.  All its standard I/O (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr)
 operations will be redirected to the parent process, where they can
 be accessed via the streams obtained using the methods
 <code>getOutputStream()</code>,
 <code>getInputStream()</code>, and
 <code>getErrorStream()</code>.
 The parent process uses these streams to feed input to and get output
 from the subprocess.  Because some native platforms only provide
 limited buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure
 to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of
 the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, or even deadlock.

 <p>Where desired, 
 subprocess I/O can also be redirected
 using methods of the <code>ProcessBuilder</code> class.

 <p>The subprocess is not killed when there are no more references to
 the <code>Process</code> object, but rather the subprocess
 continues executing asynchronously.

 <p>There is no requirement that a process represented by a <code>Process</code> object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect
 to the Java process that owns the <code>Process</code> object.

 <p>As of 1.5, <code>ProcessBuilder.start()</code> is the preferred way
 to create a <code>Process</code>.

JDK1.0

Method Detail

getOutputStream
<pre>public abstract OutputStream getOutputStream()</pre>
Returns the output stream connected to the normal input of the
 subprocess.  Output to the stream is piped into the standard
 input of the process represented by this <code>Process</code> object.

 <p>If the standard input of the subprocess has been redirected using
 <code>ProcessBuilder.redirectInput</code>
 then this method will return a
 null output stream.

 <p>Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 output stream to be buffered.

Returns:
the output stream connected to the normal input of the
         subprocess

getInputStream
<pre>public abstract InputStream getInputStream()</pre>
Returns the input stream connected to the normal output of the
 subprocess.  The stream obtains data piped from the standard
 output of the process represented by this <code>Process</code> object.

 <p>If the standard output of the subprocess has been redirected using
 <code>ProcessBuilder.redirectOutput</code>
 then this method will return a
 null input stream.

 <p>Otherwise, if the standard error of the subprocess has been
 redirected using
 <code>ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream</code>
 then the input stream returned by this method will receive the
 merged standard output and the standard error of the subprocess.

 <p>Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 input stream to be buffered.

Returns:
the input stream connected to the normal output of the
         subprocess

getErrorStream
<pre>public abstract InputStream getErrorStream()</pre>
Returns the input stream connected to the error output of the
 subprocess.  The stream obtains data piped from the error output
 of the process represented by this <code>Process</code> object.

 <p>If the standard error of the subprocess has been redirected using
 <code>ProcessBuilder.redirectError</code> or
 <code>ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream</code>
 then this method will return a
 null input stream.

 <p>Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 input stream to be buffered.

Returns:
the input stream connected to the error output of
         the subprocess

waitFor
<pre>public abstract int waitFor()
                     throws InterruptedException</pre>
Causes the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the
 process represented by this <code>Process</code> object has
 terminated.  This method returns immediately if the subprocess
 has already terminated.  If the subprocess has not yet
 terminated, the calling thread will be blocked until the
 subprocess exits.

Returns:
the exit value of the subprocess represented by this
         <code>Process</code> object.  By convention, the value
         <code>0</code> indicates normal termination.
Throws:
<code>InterruptedException</code> - if the current thread is
         interrupted by another
         thread while it is waiting, then the wait is ended and
         an <code>InterruptedException</code> is thrown.

waitFor
<pre>public boolean waitFor(long timeout,
                       TimeUnit unit)
                throws InterruptedException</pre>
Causes the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the
 subprocess represented by this <code>Process</code> object has
 terminated, or the specified waiting time elapses.

 <p>If the subprocess has already terminated then this method returns
 immediately with the value <code>true</code>.  If the process has not
 terminated and the timeout value is less than, or equal to, zero, then
 this method returns immediately with the value <code>false</code>.

 <p>The default implementation of this methods polls the <code>exitValue</code>
 to check if the process has terminated. Concrete implementations of this
 class are strongly encouraged to override this method with a more
 efficient implementation.

Parameters:
<code>timeout</code> - the maximum time to wait
<code>unit</code> - the time unit of the <code>timeout</code> argument
Returns:
<code>true</code> if the subprocess has exited and <code>false</code> if
         the waiting time elapsed before the subprocess has exited.
Throws:
<code>InterruptedException</code> - if the current thread is interrupted
         while waiting.
<code>NullPointerException</code> - if unit is null
Since:
1.8

exitValue
<pre>public abstract int exitValue()</pre>
Returns the exit value for the subprocess.

Returns:
the exit value of the subprocess represented by this
         <code>Process</code> object.  By convention, the value
         <code>0</code> indicates normal termination.
Throws:
<code>IllegalThreadStateException</code> - if the subprocess represented
         by this <code>Process</code> object has not yet terminated

destroy
<pre>public abstract void destroy()</pre>
Kills the subprocess. Whether the subprocess represented by this
 <code>Process</code> object is forcibly terminated or not is
 implementation dependent.

destroyForcibly
<pre>public Process destroyForcibly()</pre>
Kills the subprocess. The subprocess represented by this
 <code>Process</code> object is forcibly terminated.

 <p>The default implementation of this method invokes <code>destroy()</code>
 and so may not forcibly terminate the process. Concrete implementations
 of this class are strongly encouraged to override this method with a
 compliant implementation.  Invoking this method on <code>Process</code>
 objects returned by <code>ProcessBuilder.start()</code> and
 <code>Runtime.exec(java.lang.String)</code> will forcibly terminate the process.

 <p>Note: The subprocess may not terminate immediately.
 i.e. <code>isAlive()</code> may return true for a brief period
 after <code>destroyForcibly()</code> is called. This method
 may be chained to <code>waitFor()</code> if needed.

Returns:
the <code>Process</code> object representing the
         subprocess to be forcibly destroyed.
Since:
1.8

isAlive
<pre>public boolean isAlive()</pre>
Tests whether the subprocess represented by this <code>Process</code> is
 alive.

Returns:
<code>true</code> if the subprocess represented by this
         <code>Process</code> object has not yet terminated.
Since:
1.8
