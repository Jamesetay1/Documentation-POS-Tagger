<pre>public interface Key
extends Serializable</pre>
The Key interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 defines the functionality shared by all key objects. All keys
 have three characteristics:

 
An Algorithm

 This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
 <code>getAlgorithm</code> method.

 An Encoded Form

 This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 is encoded according to a standard format (such as
 X.509 <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code> or PKCS#8), and
 is returned using the <code>getEncoded</code> method.
 Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type <code>SubjectPublicKeyInfo</code>
 is defined as follows:

 <pre>
 SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }

 AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
   algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
   parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
 </pre>

 For more information, see
 RFC 3280:
 Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile.

 A Format

 This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
 by the <code>getFormat</code> method.

 

 Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 or various Identity classes used to manage keys.
 Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
 representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
 factory (see <code>KeyFactory</code>).

 <p> A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
 Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
 which should not be exposed in untrusted environments.  See the
 
 Security Appendix
 of the Serialization Specification for more information.

Method and Description

<code>String</code>
<code>getAlgorithm()</code>
Returns the standard algorithm name for this key.

<code>byte[]</code>
<code>getEncoded()</code>
Returns the key in its primary encoding format, or null
 if this key does not support encoding.

<code>String</code>
<code>getFormat()</code>
Returns the name of the primary encoding format of this key,
 or null if this key does not support encoding.

Field Detail

serialVersionUID
<pre>static final long serialVersionUID</pre>
The class fingerprint that is set to indicate
 serialization compatibility with a previous
 version of the class.

Constant Field Values

Method Detail

getAlgorithm
<pre>String getAlgorithm()</pre>
Returns the standard algorithm name for this key. For
 example, "DSA" would indicate that this key is a DSA key.
 See Appendix A in the 
 Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference 
 for information about standard algorithm names.

Returns:
the name of the algorithm associated with this key.

getFormat
<pre>String getFormat()</pre>
Returns the name of the primary encoding format of this key,
 or null if this key does not support encoding.
 The primary encoding format is
 named in terms of the appropriate ASN.1 data format, if an
 ASN.1 specification for this key exists.
 For example, the name of the ASN.1 data format for public
 keys is SubjectPublicKeyInfo, as
 defined by the X.509 standard; in this case, the returned format is
 <code>"X.509"</code>. Similarly,
 the name of the ASN.1 data format for private keys is
 PrivateKeyInfo,
 as defined by the PKCS #8 standard; in this case, the returned format is
 <code>"PKCS#8"</code>.

Returns:
the primary encoding format of the key.

getEncoded
<pre>byte[] getEncoded()</pre>
Returns the key in its primary encoding format, or null
 if this key does not support encoding.

Returns:
the encoded key, or null if the key does not support
 encoding.
