Interface RandomAccess

All Known Implementing Classes:
ArrayList, AttributeList, CopyOnWriteArrayList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList, Stack, Vector

<pre>public interface RandomAccess</pre>
Marker interface used by List implementations to indicate that
 they support fast (generally constant time) random access.  The primary
 purpose of this interface is to allow generic algorithms to alter their
 behavior to provide good performance when applied to either random or
 sequential access lists.

 <p>The best algorithms for manipulating random access lists (such as
 ArrayList) can produce quadratic behavior when applied to
 sequential access lists (such as LinkedList).  Generic list
 algorithms are encouraged to check whether the given list is an
 instanceof this interface before applying an algorithm that would
 provide poor performance if it were applied to a sequential access list,
 and to alter their behavior if necessary to guarantee acceptable
 performance.

 <p>It is recognized that the distinction between random and sequential
 access is often fuzzy.  For example, some List implementations
 provide asymptotically linear access times if they get huge, but constant
 access times in practice.  Such a List implementation
 should generally implement this interface.  As a rule of thumb, a
 List implementation should implement this interface if,
 for typical instances of the class, this loop:
 <pre>
     for (int i=0, n=list.size(); i < n; i++)
         list.get(i);
 </pre>
 runs faster than this loop:
 <pre>
     for (Iterator i=list.iterator(); i.hasNext(); )
         i.next();
 </pre>

 <p>This interface is a member of the
 
 Java Collections Framework.
